# mycategoricaldataanalysis
a categorical variable is one that can take on a limited number of possible values. 

here is where i am storing my assignments on learning different statistical methods for analyzing categorical data. 

this includes things like interpreting relative risk and odds ratios from contingency tables, testing for independence, 
creating different logit models (ie. baseline-category, cumlative), cross-validation, ROC curves, McNemar's tests, GLMs and GEEs.
